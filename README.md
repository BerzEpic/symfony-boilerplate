A example of a web application built with Vue.js, Symfony 5 and GraphQL.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Linux

Install the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

#### MacOS

We strongly recommend installing [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

Indeed, Docker has currently huge performance issues on MacOS and using
Vagrant allows us to abstract the MacOS filesystem bringing an almost Linux-like experience regarding performances.

#### Windows

Having a Linux-like terminal is strongly advised in order to run the `Makefile` commands.
Vagrant might also be an interesting solution regarding performances.

If not possible, you may also directly run the commands specified in the `Makefile`. 
For instance, instead of running `make up`, run `docker-compose up -d`.

### MacOS and Windows specific

Update your `hosts` file with the following entry:

```
127.0.0.1   *.localhost
```

On MacOs, run `sudo nano /etc/hosts` to edit it.

On Windows, edit the file `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` with administrative privileges.

If you're using Vagrant, check that there no application running 
on port 80 (like Apache or another virtual machine).

If OK, run `make vagrant`, then `vagrant up` and finally `vagrant ssh` 
in order to connect to the virtual machine. From here you'll be able to run all the next commands like
the Linux users!

> Update the variable `PROJECT_NAME` from the `Makefile` with your own project name.
> Only use alphanumeric characters (no spaces, distinguish words with `_` or `-`).

### Starting the Docker Compose stack

Copy the file `.env.dist` to a file named `.env`. For instance:

```
cp .env.dist .env
```

> Edit the `.env.dist` by updating the default values of `DOMAIN`, `MYSQL_DATABASE` and `APP_SECRET`
> environment variables.

Next make sure that there is no application running on port 80 (Vagrant users can skip this check).

Good? You may now start all the Docker containers with the following commands:

```
make up
```

It may take some time as each containers will also install dependencies (PHP, JavaScript etc.),
compile raw sources (JavaScript) or run migrations for setting up the database structure.

Next time you run this command, the containers should be ready faster as most of the 
setting up will already be done.

Once everything is ready, the following endpoints should be available:

* http://companies-and-products.localhost
* http://api.companies-and-products.localhost
* http://phpmyadmin.companies-and-products.localhost
* http://mailcatcher.companies-and-products.loclahost

> Update the domain with the one used in your project.

## What's next?

### Configuring Git

You should ignore globally some folders like those generated by your IDE and Vagrant.

If not already done, you need to tell Git where to find your global `.gitignore` file.

For instance, on Linux/MacOS/Windows git bash:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore'
```

Windows cmd:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile "%USERPROFILE%\.gitignore"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile "$Env:USERPROFILE\.gitignore"
```

Then create the global `.gitignore` file according to the location specified previously.

You may now edit it with:

```
# IDE
.idea
.vscode
# MacOS
.DS_Store
# Vagrant
.vagrant
```

### Services documentation

// TODO

### How to stop the stack?

As simple as the `make up` command, run `make down` to stop the entire Docker Compose stack.

If you're a Vagrant user, you may also stop the virtual machine with `vagrant halt`.

If you're not going to work on the project for while, you may also destroy 
the virtual machine using `vagrant destroy`.
