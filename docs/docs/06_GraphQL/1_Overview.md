> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
> GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask

The Symfony Boilerplate uses [GraphQLite](https://graphqlite.thecodingmachine.io/) to quickly build a GraphQL API based
on your models and use cases.

As the documentation of this PHP library covers a lot of aspects, we invite you to read it to have a better understanding
of its functionalities.

## Tools

The API provides the endpoint `/graphiql` (in development) so that you may quickly test a query or a mutation.

You may also use the [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altair.sirmuel.design/).
